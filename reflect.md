# Reflection on Week 05:

Unfortunately, things got a little out of hand for me this last couple weeks, so I wasn't as detail oriented as I would have liked to be. However, despite that, I think that I still did pretty good. Just a couple notes on certain things.

## Professionalism:
First and foremost, my time management was not as good as it could have been these last few weeks. I've had a lot going on (more than usual), which made it hard to juggle my responsibilities. One manifestation of that lack of time management was the final mistake I made. I corrected it a minute after the deadline, but because I was rushing, I didn't notice before I submitted it - The usual comment to mark the end of methods (i.e. `// method toString`) was not commented out. Before I added those to the end, all of my code compiled as I wanted it to, but I noticed just a little too late after adding them that they weren't commented out and causing my code not to compile. Although I did correct it, the correction was still after the deadline - which was my fault entirely.

## Coding:
I think that, for the most part, my code followed the solutions very closely (bar a couple style differences). However, the one that was the most different was the overloaded remove method for the string. My first instinct was to copy the first method (using `int`) but finding the index of the string first, and basically copy-pasting the same loop. I should have realized that I could have streamlined it in the same manner of the solution by calling the original method but making use of the `indexOf` method in the call.

Overall, again, I think that while my coding was good, what killed it was time management. I will work to get myself back to the level of time management skill I had in the beginning of this class.
